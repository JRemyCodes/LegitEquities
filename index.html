            <ul>
                <li>It is highly recommended to purchase consultation after taking courses,  as most novice investors and traders ask questions whose answers are reserved and addressed in the courses therefore making the consultation more open to topics that are not addressed in the courses resulting in better usage of your consultation. A common practical use of consultation is for the purposes to build the student conviction when materializing the material covered in the courses and seeking clarification, perspective or aid in the application of the knowledge.</li>
